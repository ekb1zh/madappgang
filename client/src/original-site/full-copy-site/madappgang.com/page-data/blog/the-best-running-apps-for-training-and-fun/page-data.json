The focus has switched from professional runners to a community of people who run to stay fit, raise awareness of social issues, or just have fun. Since mobile solutions catering to these purposes already exist, it has become a bit harder to find an untapped niche and create the next best running app.</p>\n<p>Our MadAppGang team has been working on an <a href=\"https://madappgang.com/projects/smartrun\">application for running</a> which is grounded in science and integrates AI technology. We brought the heart rate indicator into focus, providing a service that not only tracks a runner’s progress but also, and most importantly, gives training insights according to a user’s heart rate.</p>\n<p>To be distinguished among the best running apps for Android and iOS, you need to find a particular, key aspect and dedicate your program to it. The specifications and the set of features required will largely depend on your target audience.</p>\n<h2>You Can Tell the Type of Runner by the Apps They Use</h2>\n<p>People want to find a good running app which suits their individual needs and offers a personalised service. People who run are a diverse group and there are several recognizable types of runners. They could be new to running or want to get prepared for a marathon. They could be eager to socialise or would rather run alone listening to their favourite music. They could run to raise awareness or just because it’s fun. Surprisingly enough, there is a wide choice of apps for any of these preferences, and then some. </p>\n<p>Apart from third-party solutions, there are in-built programs for smart wearables including Activity for Apple Watch and Google Fit for Android Wear. They track movements and offer to set exercise goals and all the data they gather is synchronised with the user’s smartphone.</p>\n<p>Before getting started on your own application, it’s helpful to delve into the world of the existing ones.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 740px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 62.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/be32fae70d42aa9ead03944056ad2866/8d857/the-best-running-app-1.webp 185w,\n/static/be32fae70d42aa9ead03944056ad2866/844ee/the-best-running-app-1.webp 370w,\n/static/be32fae70d42aa9ead03944056ad2866/97fdf/the-best-running-app-1.webp 740w,\n/static/be32fae70d42aa9ead03944056ad2866/b7d96/the-best-running-app-1.webp 1110w,\n/static/be32fae70d42aa9ead03944056ad2866/97218/the-best-running-app-1.webp 1480w,\n/static/be32fae70d42aa9ead03944056ad2866/f07e4/the-best-running-app-1.webp 1920w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/be32fae70d42aa9ead03944056ad2866/3f118/the-best-running-app-1.png 185w,\n/static/be32fae70d42aa9ead03944056ad2866/a54ee/the-best-running-app-1.png 370w,\n/static/be32fae70d42aa9ead03944056ad2866/4dacc/the-best-running-app-1.png 740w,\n/static/be32fae70d42aa9ead03944056ad2866/cba50/the-best-running-app-1.png 1110w,\n/static/be32fae70d42aa9ead03944056ad2866/171ed/the-best-running-app-1.png 1480w,\n/static/be32fae70d42aa9ead03944056ad2866/9b4a8/the-best-running-app-1.png 1920w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\"\n          type=\"image/png\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/be32fae70d42aa9ead03944056ad2866/4dacc/the-best-running-app-1.png\"\n          alt=\"Choosing the best running app\"\n          title=\"Choosing the best running app\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n    </span></p>\n<h3>Running Apps For Training</h3>\n<p>Most running applications measure user performance and guide the runner toward better results. The competition between fitness apps for running and other activities largely centres around the complexity of the personalised training plans. The more accurate the health data and the more scientific the technology behind the recommendations, the more likely it is that an app will succeed.</p>\n<p>At MadAppGang we’ve been working on an <a href=\"https://madappgang.com/projects/smartrun\">application for runners</a> which is, unlike the majority of running apps, focused on health rather than performance. We took the heart rate as the basis for our running application. We did this so the training process would follow the accepted system of workouts within heart rate zones; consideration of these is needed for safe and efficient exercise. </p>\n<p>Real-time data from a heart rate sensor and time tracking are two integral components in our app SmartRun. The app embodies the ideals of healthy training by dividing activity levels into five described zones which correlate to user heart rates: relax, fat burn, aerobic, endurance, and extreme. The project is currently in the testing stage and will be available in app stores soon.</p>\n<p>SmartRun’s training plans are designed to be highly individualised and are set according to a user’s parameters and adjusted as needed. Recommendations are based on the received data with the help of AI technology. Smart and personalised service like this is what modern-day users expect from any fitness-related app.</p>\n<p>Let’s see what the most popular running apps currently on the market offer.</p>\n<p><strong>Runtastic</strong></p>\n<p><em>80+ million users</em><br>\n<em>iOS / Android / Apple Watch / Android Wear / Compatible with other wearables</em><br>\n<em>Free / From $4.99 per month for personalised training and nutrition plans</em><br>\n<em>Launched in 2009</em><br>\n<em>Acquired by Adidas in 2015</em></p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 300px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 216.33333333333334%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/32fb371704758c136b9b625c4df1c640/8d857/300x0w-5.webp 185w,\n/static/32fb371704758c136b9b625c4df1c640/fe453/300x0w-5.webp 300w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/32fb371704758c136b9b625c4df1c640/353b0/300x0w-5.jpg 185w,\n/static/32fb371704758c136b9b625c4df1c640/4ce9f/300x0w-5.jpg 300w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/32fb371704758c136b9b625c4df1c640/4ce9f/300x0w-5.jpg\"\n          alt=\"Runtastic app\"\n          title=\"Runtastic app\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n    </span></p>\n<p><em>Source: iTunes</em></p>\n<p>Runtastic has a whole bunch of health and fitness applications that track user activity, heart rate, and sleep cycles. The app can also guide users through various training plans or build diet plans. The company produces fitness wearables as well. A significant focus is on those who struggle to lose weight; there’s a dedicated section on Runtastic’s blog where users share their weight-loss success stories.</p>\n<p>Like most running apps, Runtastic features challenges. For even stronger motivation during the process, are perhaps a few cheers, there’s a live broadcast option. Users can also share their activities on Facebook to get inspired by friends’ reactions.</p>\n<p>There are short training sessions with voiced guidance which are customizable regarding the number of intervals, their duration, and intensity. A unique feature which Runtastic includes is shoe tracking − it analyses a user’s performance in different shoes and makes recommends as to when it’s time to retire the current pair.</p>\n<p><strong>Runkeeper</strong></p>\n<p><em>50+ million users</em><br>\n<em>iOS / Android / Apple Watch / Android Wear / Compatible with other wearables</em><br>\n<em>Free / $7.5 per month for more details on progress and other features</em> <br>\n<em>Launched in 2008</em><br>\n<em>Acquired by Asics in 2016</em></p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 300px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 177.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/30156d3ba617a9d768b505423eb97d53/8d857/300x0w-4.webp 185w,\n/static/30156d3ba617a9d768b505423eb97d53/fe453/300x0w-4.webp 300w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/30156d3ba617a9d768b505423eb97d53/353b0/300x0w-4.jpg 185w,\n/static/30156d3ba617a9d768b505423eb97d53/4ce9f/300x0w-4.jpg 300w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/30156d3ba617a9d768b505423eb97d53/4ce9f/300x0w-4.jpg\"\n          alt=\"Runkeeper app\"\n          title=\"Runkeeper app\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n    </span></p>\n<p><em>Source: iTunes</em></p>\n<p>Founder and CEO Jason Jacobs claims that Runkeeper was born out of his own personal passion for running and the desire to help like-minded enthusiasts run more. The company also made the Breeze app which functions in the background and tracks every movement, but they decided to <a href=\"https://blog.runkeeper.com/3419/we-love-you-breeze-thanks-for-everything/\">halt its development</a> and totally focus on improving Runkeeper. </p>\n<p>Runkeeper is quite a universal tool which tracks all running, walking, and hiking activity and encourages users to set and achieve new fitness goals. There are also regular challenges for users to join. </p>\n<p>In the application users can set plans and add information about their schedules. The app then sends notifications about when a user has free time to run. In RunkeeperGo, which is a premium version, weekly workout recommendations according to fitness level, weather updates, and more personalised features are offered.</p>\n<p>Runners can share their data via Facebook or with friends who also use Runkeeper. Another crucial feature is the app’s connection to Spotify and iTunes − favourite playlists are an integral part of the process for most runners. Runkeeper also synchronises with several partner apps: HealthKit, Fitbit, TomTom MySports, Google Fit.</p>\n<p><strong>MapMyRun</strong></p>\n<p><em>50+ million users</em><br>\n<em>iOS / Android / Apple Watch / Android Wear / Compatible with other wearables</em><br>\n<em>Free / $5.99 per month for the ad-free app with more detailed analysis</em><br>\n<em>Launched in 2008 / Premium subscription launched 2013</em> <br>\n<em>Acquired by Under Armour in 2015</em></p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 300px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 216.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/2622b005b80e769b33e34ea1fc605f30/8d857/300x0w-3.webp 185w,\n/static/2622b005b80e769b33e34ea1fc605f30/fe453/300x0w-3.webp 300w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/2622b005b80e769b33e34ea1fc605f30/353b0/300x0w-3.jpg 185w,\n/static/2622b005b80e769b33e34ea1fc605f30/4ce9f/300x0w-3.jpg 300w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/2622b005b80e769b33e34ea1fc605f30/4ce9f/300x0w-3.jpg\"\n          alt=\"MapMyRun app\"\n          title=\"MapMyRun app\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n    </span></p>\n<p><em>Source: iTunes</em></p>\n<p>MapMyFitness provides a number of health-related services including MapMyRun.

Impressed by the social nature of cycling, the app’s founders starting planning Strava in their college years during the 90s. They wanted to build a community where fitness enthusiasts could analyse their performance and compare it with each other.</p>\n<p>The name of the application comes from the Swedish for ‘to strive’ and its main purpose lies in motivation and entertainment. The program can identify different types of activity including walking, running, and climbing, and give users the opportunity to compare and contrast their results.</p>\n<p>Strava has a trophy system with challenges, while personalised recommendations are included in the paid version, which is called Strava Summit. The company also launched an in-app store with branded kit and partner wearables but closed it in 2016.</p>\n<p>An interesting fact about this project is the Strava Metro program which aims to initiate changes to infrastructure and make the lives of runners and cyclers easier and safer. Co-founder Mark Gainey has noted that <a href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research/strava-fitness-tracking-data-aha/\">data-driven insights</a> are crucial for this business and the valuable information detailing user activity can enhance city planning efforts.</p>\n<p>Strava claims to have a distinction in its business model since all its major competitors were bought by sports apparel brands. While these apps promote running along with promoting new shoes, Strava remains focused on selling subscriptions.</p>\n<p><strong>Endomondo</strong></p>\n<p><em>25+ million users</em><br>\n<em>iOS / Android / Apple Watch / Android Wear / Samsung Gear (Not all versions of wearables are supported)</em><br>\n<em>Free / $5.99 per month for the ad-free app with personalised plans and stats</em><br>\n<em>Launched in 2007</em><br>\n<em>Acquired by Under Armour in 2015</em></p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 300px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 177.66666666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/51e789ac42069da4f67fc33187087fc7/8d857/300x0w-7.webp 185w,\n/static/51e789ac42069da4f67fc33187087fc7/fe453/300x0w-7.webp 300w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/51e789ac42069da4f67fc33187087fc7/353b0/300x0w-7.jpg 185w,\n/static/51e789ac42069da4f67fc33187087fc7/4ce9f/300x0w-7.jpg 300w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/51e789ac42069da4f67fc33187087fc7/4ce9f/300x0w-7.jpg\"\n          alt=\"Endomondo app\"\n          title=\"Endomondo app\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n    </span></p>\n<p><em>Source: iTunes</em></p>\n<p>Endomondo’s founder, Mette Lykke, wanted to create a web-based fitness platform at first, but the team quickly realised they needed a mobile solution.

All commitments users make can be edited or paused.</p>\n<p>Because it’s a a community-driven service, Endomondo offers the ability to cheers others on in messages inside the app and share workout activities on Facebook. The premium version offers interactive performance graphs, a tool for calculating the amount of fluids needed based on weight, weather, and the workout details, along with some other features.</p>\n<p>Users can also customise the training process according to heart rate zones − although this option requires integration with Garmin devices.

For example, after making progress, users may receive rewards such as a Starbucks gift card, new shoes, or headphones. The app features weekly challenges with a limited amount of gifts from big partner brands. Apart from rewarding and motivating users, Running Heroes also regularly <a href=\"https://www.runnersradar.com/running-news/running-heroes-mymilematters/\">collects money for charity</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Others</strong></p>\n<p>Whether it’s music, the power of storytelling, or motivation from a running community, there are many ways of boosting run performance and frequency. While performance-oriented fitness trackers focus mainly on helping users make strides, running is much more than just progress. It can be about discovering new places, meeting like-minded people, or fundraising: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some apps are dedicated to managing the workout data collected in other applications. For this purpose, iSmoothRun and RunGap are among the best running apps for iPhone</li>\n<li>Travel running apps, including RunGo and Runnin’ City, provide navigation guides which combine sightseeing with jogging or walking</li>\n<li>Social apps such as Runmates help people find running buddies</li>\n<li>Apps like RaceRunner serve fundraising purposes</li>\n<li>Inventive and lively exergames such as Run An Empire combine missions with exercise</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Health Data and Privacy Are the Biggest Challenges When Developing a Running App</h2>\n<p>The main advantage of up-to-date running apps lies in accurate health data collection. While having your heart rate measured can help tailor better training recommendations, it also represents a significant privacy threat. </p>\n<p>From tracking user location in the background, sending data to third-party businesses, to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/16/james-quarles-strava-fitness-app-social-network-interview\">exposure of military bases</a> through heatmaps, fitness trackers can intrude upon privacy in many ways. The question of who owns a given user’s health data also rises when switching from one running application to another. People should check how to save and export their data.</p>\n<p>Another big drawback that comes to light is the potential for unhealthy competition, which can lead to users “cheating” the apps or overtraining. For a healthy running experience, an app with a science-based methodology and a focus on balanced training is best. </p>\n<p>While fun challenges are, well... fun, they shouldn’t be overused just to engage more people. The crux of the matter seems to be getting the balance between levity and seriousness right: the best running tracker app should be fun and easy to use but also health-conscious and sensible. It goes without saying that any app designed to help users get healthy needs to be rooted in solid science.</p>\n<p>As we’ve seen, the running app market is crowded with the big names taking up quite a lot of the market share, but there are a few untapped niches and angles available yet.
