This lengthy process creates an unbiased review, with the client’s input being one of the major sources of Clutch’s ratings. It is for this exact reason that we are so happy to have been rated highly by Clutch, and we would like to include some of our client reviews on our profile below:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Their ability to adapt to changing circumstances and come up with creative solutions really sets them apart.” − CEO of the Food Ordering Company</p>\n<p>“I’ve worked with developers from all over the world, and MadAppGang is in the top 2%-3% I’ve ever seen.” − CEO of the WallBrand </p>\n</blockquote>\n<img class=\"full-width\" src=\"/uploads/clutch-awards-title.png\" alt=\"Clutch awards title\" />\n<p>Clutch also has two sister sites, The Manifest and Visual Objects. </p>\n<p>The Manifest is similar to Clutch but offers potential clients with a quicker view of the companies listed on the site. It gives company information such as size, location, and services offered, all at a glance. The Manifest also offers a How-To Guide that seeks to inform clients looking to buy the services of a third-party site with the information necessary to employ the services of the company. We invite you to check us out on The Manifest’s list of the top AI companies.</p>\n<p>Visual Objects is Clutch’s newest sister site which offers clients the ability to compare creative design companies based upon their past works. The site accomplishes this by creating a visual portfolio for each company. This allows the client to quickly view three of the companies past works by scrolling down on the website. We are featured on Visual Objects as one of the top app development companies. </p>\n<p><strong>We are incredibly proud of our rankings on Clutch, The Manifest, and Visual Objects.</strong> We thank Clutch for providing us with this valuable information and of course, we thank our clients for taking the time to leave such stellar reviews. We look forward to continuing our tradition of quality and serving our clients with the best products we can provide.</p>","frontmatter":{"banner":"/uploads/clutch-awards-title-dark.png","socialGraphImage":"/uploads/clutch-awards-social.png","date":"04 July 2019","title":"Clutch Reviewed MadAppGang as a Top Wearable App Developer","tags":["Clutch ranking","wearable app development"],"seoTitle":"Clutch Reviewed MadAppGang as a Top Wearable App Developer","seoDescription":"MadAppGang was recognized among the best mobile app developers on Clutch, The Manifest, and Visual Objects.","authors":[{"name":"MadAppGang","position":"-","photo":"/uploads/mag.jpg"}]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"1f23d136-b2ce-5bd2-af2b-b97adc053664","socialGraphImage":"/uploads/clutch-awards-social.png","seoTitle":"Clutch Reviewed MadAppGang as a Top Wearable App Developer","seoDescription":"MadAppGang was recognized among the best mobile app developers on Clutch, The Manifest, and Visual Objects."}}}
